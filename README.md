# The XC Programming Language ![GNU GPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL3-c50112)

**XC** is a statically typed, compiled, procedural programming language designed for general-purpose use.

## Getting Started

Compiling and running the XC compiler is quite simple and straightforward.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- `make`
- `g++`, `clang++`, or any other C++ compiler that supports `C++17`
> [!NOTE]
> By default it will compile with `g++`, so if you decide to not use `g++`, please assign the compiler of your choice when using make.

### Building

Once you have those dependencies install, all you need to do is go to the `build` directory and run:

```bash
make COMPILER="g++"
```

> [!TIP]
> The `COMPILER` variable can be omitted if you want to compile the project with `g++`. If you decide to use another C++ compiler, replace `g++` with your desired C++ compiler.

> [!CAUTION]
> Any C++ compiler other than `g++` has not been tested.

If all goes well, there will be a new executable file called `xc` located in the `build/bin` directory.

### Running

Now all that is left to do it is to run it by:

```bash
./xc
```

## Project Organization

The XC project is organized as follows:

```
.
├── build/
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── obj/
│   └── Makefile
├── docs/
├── src/
│   └── include/
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build/`  | Contains the `Makefile` used to build the project. During the build process, object files will be generated in the `build/obj` directory. Once the build is complete, the executable will be located in the `build/bin` directory. |
| `docs/`   | Contains additional documentation, including the language's _grammar_ and _specifications_.                                                                                                                                        |
| `src/`    | Contains the C++ source code files. Header files are located in the `src/include` directory.                                                                                                                                       |
